                    <p>Asteroids are rocky objects orbiting the Sun – with millions of them
                        contained in solar orbit in the asteroid belt situated between Mars and
                        Jupiter. Those of size less than 300 km have irregular shape because
                        their gravity is too weak to compress them into spheres. Some of the
                        asteroids, such as Ceres with a diameter of about 10 6 m, are large
                        enough to be considered as “minor planets”.</p>
