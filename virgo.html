                    <h1>VIRGO, THE MAIDEN</h1>
                    <p>
                        Virgo is the second-largest constellation -- so big that it takes about four hours for the whole
                        thing to clear the eastern horizon. To the unaided eye, though, that huge area is basically a
                        void, because only one bright star resides within its borders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In mythology, Virgo was associated with the harvest. It represented a harvest goddess or the
                        daughter of a goddess. The constellation's brightest star, Spica, was a stalk of wheat held in
                        her hand. Virgo was associated with the harvest because the Sun passed across the constellation
                        during late summer or early autumn, when farmers were reaping the crops they had planted months
                        earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Virgo is known as a spring constellation because, although you can see some or all of its stars
                        on most nights of the year, the stars put on their best display in the evening sky during
                        spring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although blue-white Spica is Virgo's only bright star, it is the 16th-brightest star in the
                        night sky. It actually consists of two stars, both of which are much hotter, brighter, and
                        heavier than the Sun. But they are separated by only about 10 million miles, so from Spica's
                        distance of 260 light-years, it is impossible to see them as individual stars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the stars are big, heavy, and close together, they exert such a strong gravitational tug
                        on each other that each star causes the other to bulge outward. Seen in profile, the system
                        would look like two eggs with the narrow ends pointed at each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the next few million years, the heavier star will near the end of its “normal” lifetime, so
                        it will puff up to many times its current size. As it swells, some of its gas will begin to dump
                        onto the surface of the other star. And as it gets even bigger, its outer layers will engulf its
                        partner, pulling the two stellar cores closer together. No one knows exactly how the scenario
                        will play out after that. The stars may merge to form a single star, or the larger star may
                        explode before that can happen, blasting itself to bits and perhaps sending its companion
                        careening through the galaxy like a stellar bullet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second-brightest star in Virgo, Gamma Virginis, is also a binary system. Unlike Spica, its
                        stars are so far apart that binoculars easily reveal them as individual stars. They are about 40
                        light-years from Earth. The stars are both white, which means their surfaces are a little hotter
                        than the surface of the Sun. They're both brighter than the Sun, too.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Gamma Virginis has been known by several other names over the centuries. One of the most
                        enduring is Porrima, for the goddess of prophecy. In ancient Babylon, it was called Star of the
                        Hero, and in China, it was the High Minister of State.
