                    <h1>ARIES, THE RAM</h1>
                    <p>Aries is famous not because of its brilliance, though, but because of its location: It is one of
                        the 12 constellations of the zodiac. These constellations straddle the Sun's path across the
                        sky, known as the ecliptic. In ancient times, that gave these regions of the sky extra
                        significance.
                    </p>

                    <p> Aries was the most significant of all. At the time the constellations were named, the Sun
                        appeared against the stars of Aries at the vernal equinox, which is the first day of spring in
                        the northern hemisphere. With the earth awakening from its winter slumber, the equinox was a
                        time of celebration. And it usually marked the beginning of a new year.
                    </p>
                    <p> Today, the Sun's location at the equinox is still known as the "first point of Aries," even
                        though the Sun is in Pisces. The change is caused by a slow wobble in Earth's axis. The Sun will
                        return to Aries -- and the ram will regain his status as the leader of the zodiacal flock --
                        when we complete one full wobble, in about 22,000 years.
                    </p>
                    <p> Hamal, the constellation's brightest star, is classified as an orange giant. That means it
                        is much larger and brighter than the Sun -- bright enough to see even though it is more than 65
                        light-years away. Giant stars have burned through the original hydrogen fuel in their cores. The
                        cores "retool" to process other elements: They shrink and get hotter. In response, the outer
                        layers puff outward. A giant can expand from about the size of the Sun, which is less than a
                        million miles in diameter, to tens of millions of miles. Hamal has one known planet, which is a
                        giant ball of gas similar to Jupiter, the giant of our own solar system. It's so close to Hamal
                        that its atmosphere is being blown off into space.
                    </p>
                    <p> One of the ram's most important stars is too faint to see without a telescope. Yet half a
                        century ago, it played a key role in a revolutionary discovery: Most of the chemical elements on
                        Earth -- and in our bodies -- were forged in the stars.
                    </p>
                    <p> For a long time, scientists didn't know where the oxygen, silicon, iron, and other heavy
                        elements that make up Earth came from. A faint star in Aries, HD 19445, along with a star in
                        Libra, helped point the way.
                    </p>
                    <p> In 1951, astronomers reported that these two stars had much less iron and calcium than the
                        Sun. It was a shocking report, because most astronomers thought that nearly all stars had the
                        same composition. Around this time, though, they realized that the two iron-deficient stars were
                        very old, so they had formed in the galaxy's earliest years. Since the stars had little iron, it
                        meant that the young galaxy itself had little iron. The galaxy has grown more iron-rich over
                        time, though, as stars created iron and spewed it into space. So younger stars like the Sun have
                        higher concentrations of iron and other heavy elements than older stars. The implication of this
                        discovery was simple but profound: The stars created the iron in our blood, the calcium in our
                        bones, and the oxygen we breathe.</p>
