                    <h1>LEO, THE LION</h1>
                    <p>The zodiacal constellation Leo, the lion, is one of a handful of constellations that really does
                        look like its namesake. It consists of two patterns of stars that the brain puts together to
                        make a lion. A backward question mark represents the head and mane, and a triangle of stars to
                        the lower left forms the lion's hindquarters and tail. Look for Leo high in the south in April
                        and May.
                    </p>
                    <p>Leo's brightest star is blue-white Regulus, one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It is
                        about 79 light-years away. Regulus rises almost due east, with the body of the lion following it
                        into the sky over the next couple of hours. Once Regulus climbs into the sky, look to its left —
                        toward the north — for the backwards question mark, known as the Sickle, that outlines his head
                        and mane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About two hours later, look low in the east for Leo's tail — a white star named Denebola, which
                        comes from an Arabic name that, appropriately enough, means "tail of the lion."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At a distance of just 36 light-years, Denebola is a fairly close neighbor. Even so, the fact
                        that we can see it at all means that Denebola is quite bright -- more than 10 times brighter
                        than the Sun. Denebola's brightness is a product of its mass. The star is about twice as heavy
                        as the Sun, so it "fuses" the hydrogen in its core at a much faster rate. That makes the star's
                        surface thousands of degrees hotter than the Sun's. The combination of high temperature and
                        large size makes Denebola outshine the Sun and all but a few percent of all the stars in the
                        Milky Way galaxy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Denebola is surrounded by a disk of dust grains. It may be supplied with fresh material by
                        collisions between small planet-building bodies. So far, no one has seen any evidence of planets
                        around the star, although they can't be ruled out, either. Astronomers continue to hunt for
                        companions to this bright stellar neighbor.
