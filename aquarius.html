                    <h1>AQUARIUS, THE WATER-BEARER</h1>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to its position in the zodiac, not to mention a hit Broadway song, Aquarius the water
                        bearer, is one of the most famous constellations. But few people actually see it because it's so
                        faint. It is home to the summer Delta Aquarid meteor shower, which, like the constellation
                        itself, is fairly thin and sparse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several of the stars of Aquarius have names that signify luck or good fortune. The most
                        prominent examples are the constellation's two brightest stars, Sadalmelik and Sadalsuud. The
                        names are from ancient Arabic, and mean "lucky one of the king" and "luckiest of the lucky." The
                        names may refer to the stars' positions. When the constellations were named, the Sun passed
                        through this region of the sky in early spring, when the long nights of winter had passed and
                        the new season brought life-giving rains. Aquarius is one of several "watery" constellations in
                        that part of the sky.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The constellation is home to the globular cluster M2. It is 38,000 light-years from Earth, but
                        is bright enough to see through binoculars because it consists of about 100,000 stars packed
                        into a dense ball just a few light-years in diameter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cluster is one of the oldest objects in the galaxy, so all of its bright, heavy stars have
                        long since expired. The brightest stars in M2 today are yellow and orange giants — stars that
                        were once like the Sun, but that expanded and brightened as they consumed the nuclear fuel in
                        their cores. M2 doesn't belong to the Milky Way galaxy’s flat disk. In fact, the disk didn’t
                        even exist when M2 was born. Instead, M2 is part of the galaxy’s halo — a shell of stars that
                        surrounds the disk.
                    </p>ƒ
                    <p>
                        Another of Aquarius' wonders is an obscure star system known as Gliese 876. The star itself is a
                        red dwarf, about a third as massive as the Sun but only about a thousandth as bright. So even
                        though it is just 15 light-years away, it is far too faint to see without a telescope. The
                        system contains at least four planets, including one that may be one of the most Earth-like
                        worlds yet discovered. From a tiny "wobble" in the star's light caused by the planet's
                        gravitational pull, along with other evidence, astronomers calculate that the planet probably is
                        about twice as big as Earth and a few times more massive. Like Earth, it's probably a rocky
                        world. And its gravity is strong enough to retain any atmosphere it was born with. The planet
                        isn't a likely home for life, though, because it's so close to Gliese 876 that surface
                        temperatures reach hundreds of degrees. So if anything lives on the planet, it would have to be
                        quite different from life on Earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        M6 is farther than M7, so it doesn’t look as big or bright, so you need dark skies to see it
                        without optical aid. Through binoculars or a telescope, the cluster’s colorful stars form a
                        pattern that resembles the outline of a butterfly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another system in Aquarius, K2-138, contains at least six planets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        K2-138 consists of a cool orange star that’s almost as big as the Sun. Volunteers in a
                        crowdsourcing project sorted through observations of the system by Kepler, a planet-hunting
                        space telescope, and discovered five planets. All of them are closer to the star than Mercury is
                        to the Sun. The project also found evidence of a sixth planet, but Kepler shut down before it
                        could confirm the planet. Instead, astronomers aimed another space telescope at the system,
                        which confirmed the sixth planet.
